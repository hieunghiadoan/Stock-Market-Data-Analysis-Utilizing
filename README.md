# **Stock Market Data Analysis Utilizing Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)**
## **Abstract:**

This academic task revolves around the application of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) for the analysis of stock market data. The primary aim is to create a VBA script capable of processing stock data for a one-year duration. The script is designed to compute and output essential information, including the respective stock's ticker symbol, the annual change in stock price (from the opening price at the commencement of the year to the closing price at year-end), the percentage change in stock price over the same period, and the cumulative stock volume.

Furthermore, as an additional challenge, the script's functionality is extended to identify and provide details regarding stocks that exhibit the "Greatest Percentage Increase," "Greatest Percentage Decrease," and "Greatest Total Volume."

This academic endeavor aligns with the broader context of quantitative finance and data analysis, offering a practical application of VBA for stock market data processing and analysis. The utilization of programming and computational tools in financial analysis is a prevalent practice in modern finance, allowing for the extraction of valuable insights and informed decision-making in the realm of investments and asset management.



**Instructions:**

**Objective:** Develop a VBA script that iterates through all stocks over a one-year period and produces the following information:

1. The ticker symbol.
2. The annual change in stock price, calculated from the opening price at the year's commencement to the closing price at year-end.
3. The percentage change in stock price, derived from the opening price at the year's outset to the closing price at year-end.
4. The cumulative stock volume.

**Additional Challenge:**

Enhance the script's functionality to identify and present information regarding stocks with the "Greatest Percentage Increase," "Greatest Percentage Decrease," and "Greatest Total Volume."

## Multiple years stock market data

This file has been recorded with larger dataset (3000 securities) throughout 3 years (2018, 2019, 2020).

The purpose of this file will be an official version to apply VBA script to analyze the stock market data through the changes in stock prices, percentage changes, and those volume every period of time.
